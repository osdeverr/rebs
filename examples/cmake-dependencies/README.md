# cmake-dependencies - Re is friends with everything!

This project showcases Re's out-of-the-box support for CMake dependencies. It loads [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) and [nlohmann-json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) straight from their official GitHub repos - just to remind you,  those projects know nothing about Re and haven't adapted to it in any way.

The dependencies' versions are pinned like in NPM to be above a certain version.

Build this project by typing `re`. Use `re run` to start it (it builds it if needed too!).
