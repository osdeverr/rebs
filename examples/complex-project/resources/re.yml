# Custom targets do not create any arfifacts on their own but allow for custom actions to be taken at their build time.

type: custom
name: resources

#
# The actions for this build are simple - we just copy all .txt files in this target's directory into the out directory of all targets that depend on it.
# You can specify actions using this field even in non-custom targets: we only use a custom one here because nothing is being "built".
#
actions:
    #
    # This action copies the specified files from the target's source directory to the output directories of all targets that depend on it.

    - copy-to-deps:
        from: "*" # The root directory for this parameter is the source directory of the current target.
        to: "resources/" # The root directory for this parameter is the output directory of the target that depends on it.
