#
# Dependencies are resolved from most internal to most external - i.e. libhello will always refer to the local library in this context.
# If the target is not found in the local project, globally installed dependencies are being searched. 
#
# Dependency namespaces are used to distinguish between dependencies from different sources, like GitHub or package managers.
# To force-refer to a globally installed target, use the "global:" namespace prefix before the target name. (No spaces!)
#
deps:
    - libhello
    - resources
    #- spp

# Namespaced Deps Example:
deps-example:
    - global:fmt
    - github:K2Rate/ulib-re
    - vcpkg:nlohmann-json@>=1.0.2
