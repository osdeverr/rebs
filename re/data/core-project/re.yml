# *** Re Core Project ***
#
# This file defines the "root" project target for all Re targets.
# Its purpose is to take out some default settings that would've otherwise been hardcoded in the Re executable into an easily modifiable file.
# You can specify your own core project path while invoking re instead of using this file.
