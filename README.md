# Re - a modern build system for the future

**WARNING:** Re is still under development, and problems may very well arise. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/osdeverr/rebs/issues/new) if something goes wrong or [create a pull request](https://github.com/osdeverr/rebs/pulls) if you wanna make something right.

## Why Re?

### It just works

Building Re projects doesn’t require you to configure them, write build scripts or really do anything else — just type in “re” in your command line and you’re all set!

### It likes company

Re integrates with Microsoft's [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) package manager, allowing you to access tons of useful packages from the get-go. No special setup needed - it's available out of the box!

### It's not stupid

Re automatically gathers the source tree for every project you build, allowing you to focus on the actual important part of software development - *writing code.*

### It's quite fast

Despite its extensive features, Re does not struggle to perform and does its job at an acceptable speed. *(TODO: performance comparisons!)*
